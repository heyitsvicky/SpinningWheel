# SpinningWheel
 This is a wheel of fortune type of thing where you click the button to spin the wheel and the pointer will land on a random result. This was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I plan to update this so the user can input their own items in the future. You can find the interactive wheel at this link:
